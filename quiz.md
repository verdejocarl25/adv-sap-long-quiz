## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
Based on my research, Service-Oriented Architecture acts like a connector or an adapter to a business in which it connects services that instead of recreating or reusing some service over different systems, combine services to serve much more complex tasks. It is a bundle of services that is reusable and interactive which makes them to be easily incorporated into new systems.


2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
STANDARDIZED SERVICE CONTRACTS

As the names suggest in this characteristic, it handles the service used for, it describes its purpose, and capabilities, and uses regulated service contracts.
LOOSE COUPLING

Loose Coupling creates a more connected place between elements, so if there is a change the other services will be notified or changed, to reduce dependencies between service aspects.
ABSTRACTION

It hides the service from the outside world by encapsulating the information that is related to the service and prevents unnecessary data from being abundant in the service and it plays a critical role in service composition.
SERVICE REUSABILITY

As the name suggests this characteristic is you the service to be highly reusable in different circumstances.
AUTONOMY

It is also expected that the service is automated means there is no need for outside intervention, the system must handle minor things to increase its reliability and predictability.
STATELESSNESS

The service must be scalable which means it can be used in the future or be upgraded, so if there is a need to reduce or add a new feature it will not cause any anomalies that would cause trouble.
DISCOVERABILITY

As a service, it must include a discovery method for its service registry to find appropriate metadata much more efficiently and easily.
COMPOSABILITY

The service must divide complex and large problems into smaller parts to alleviate its maintenance, it is also expected that the service is flexible and highly tuned to allow different functions to meet its requirements.
INTEROPERABILITY

The service should follow standard regulations to allow a wide range of subscribers to be able to use the service.

3. Define Microservices.
It is similar to the Service Oriented Architecture, in which it offers the same characteristics like being reusable and a collection of services however its target is not the large-scale enterprises but small businesses and organizations, microservice provides a much agile, scalable, and resilient service for individual application uses.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
The benefit of using microservices is their deployability they can be deployed with fewer efforts compared to a much larger scaled service that takes time to implement small changes, it is also beneficial to employees since with a small code they can understand it much easier and faster requiring a little effort, aside from that microservices is highly modifiable and can be sculpted to a specific use, not only that microservice also offer cloud-based services which make data to be accessible anywhere.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences between SOA and Microservices.
Both Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices offer the same thing they both offer a much easier and more reliable function to an organization with their reusability, scaling, and compatibility features it feels a requirement to have one since it enables efficient use of resources and time, and their only difference is the target appropriateness in use Service Oriented Architecture will prove best for large-scale enterprises that have a lot of resources in terms of manpower and margin as for the Microservices as the name suggests it is for a much smaller organization with fewer resource however due to its size it is proven to be more agile, and easy to handle with it being modified to a specific use.

6. Define Web Services.
Web services is a piece of software that is made available in the internet. Web service is a collection of open protocol and standards used in exchanging data between applications, and can be used in different platforms to exchange data for example the internet.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
Exposing the Existing Function on the network - The web services code can be viewed by users revealing its functionality over the internet

Interoperability - Allows web services to talk to other web services which they can share analytics, data and services

Standardized Protocol - The web service uses the standardized protocol which allows business owner or owners in general to be versatile, reduce cost due to competitions, and being standarized increase in quality

Low Cost Communication - The web service uses SOAP instead of HTTP protocol, which allows them to use low cost internet for implementing there services and can also be implemented in other reliable transport mechanisms 

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
XML-Based - Web services uses XML which eliminates networking bindings, and allows web services based application to be highly interoperable

Loosely Coupled - Allows web services to be updated and changed without limiting or restricting the accessibility of a user, which is the client side and server logic are loosely tied which allows this process

Coarse-Grained - holds a bundle of related data which provide a broaded functionalities which is why it is commonly used in a corporate level it also grant a good amount of business logic  for access

Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous - Allows client synchronicity which tied them to a specific service unable to perform other things, while in asynchronicity clients can use a service while simultaneously can access other services, and they bussiness can set mode between them.

Support Remote Procedure Call - Allows client to invoke different things on the web service like procedures, functions, and methods on remote object by using XML-based protocols

Supports Document Exchange - XML has a clever way of showing or representing data to simple to complex ones. Since it supports an transparent exchange of documents to facilitates  

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
Provider - The one who creates the web service to be made available for those clients who wants it

Requestor - The client who contacts the web service to look for the web service functionality

Broker - The one who provide access to the UDDI, The UDDi enables the client application to locate and access the web service

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.

SOAP (Simple Obeject Access Protocol)- is an XML-based protocol that allows the exchange of information between computers, it also communicates communication protocol between applications

WSDL (Web Services Description Languages) -  an XML- based language which is in charge for describing the web service and a way on how it can be accessed, it is also an integral part of UDDI that facilitates businesses to be listed in the internet

UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) - an XML-based standard in charge of describing, publishing, and finding web services, it is an open framework and platform independent and seen as one of the three foundation standards of web services besides SOAP and WSDL
